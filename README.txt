Using machine learning techniques to understand contraceptive use.

I created this project to get hands-on practice with machine learning techniques using the same dataset I used for my dissertation. My aim is to focus entirely on the principles of machine learning and am therefore using a dataset I am very familiar with so my time spent on variable treatment is minimal.

2011 - 2017 data were downloaded from the National Survey of Family Growth website and created from .dat files using the SAS programs provided by NSFG.
